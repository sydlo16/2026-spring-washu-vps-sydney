INSTRUCTIONS:

1) If you don't already have it, download the program VSCode.
   (It's a text code editor. If you have / prefer a different one, that's fine too.)

2) Open up VSCode and start a new file.

3) Copy the complete code from my example. (This code you're reading here.)
   Paste this code into your new file.
   Save this file as the name "profile-card.html" and save it somewhere on your computer that you can easily access.

4) Open this file ("profile-card.html") in a web browser — like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Arc, etc.

5) Go back to VSCode and make sure to have "profile-card.html" open.

6) Modify your profile-card.html to make your own profile card for this class.
   Scroll below and follow the comments for guidance.
   Note that anything after <body> and before </body> will be shown visibly on the page.
   Try making a change, saving your file (command + S on Mac), and then refreshing the version in your web browser to see the update.
   Keep going...

   * Make sure it looks, reads, and feels accurate to you.

   * Fill in your own name, your favorite color, your favorite aspect ratio 
     (after you research them), etc. to make this possible.

   * If you feel compelled, put in the comments why you chose these things.

   * If you want to add a simple section or two, go ahead...
   
   * This website is written in HTML and CSS. 
     Right now it's not important to know everything about them.
     Just try editing a little of this page and viewing the result after you press "Save."
     Keep doing this until you like your own ID card...
    
 7) We will share our ID cards near the end of class!

 If you are feeling advanced, there are tips on how to create a GitHub repository etc. at the bottom to put this site on the web...
 But no rush...

<!--

1) If you don't have one already, create an account on GitHub.com.

2) Once you log into GitHub, create a new repository. 
   (It's usually a green button you'll click to do this.)
   Title the repository: 2026-spring-washu-vps-laurel (although with your name at the end, not mine)

3) Once you create the repository, where it says "Quick Setup", click the link "create a new file."
   If for some reason you can't find this, try finding a "+" (plus) button to create a new file within your repository.

4) Name the file "profile-card.html" at the top.

5) Copy the complete code here. (That is, this code here, that you've been editing.)
   Paste this code into the body of your "profile-card.html".

6) Press the button "Commit changes..." at the top right. 
   (It's also a green button.)
   If there is a popup, press "Commit changes" again.

7) Then, back in your repository, press the tab "Settings" at the top right.

8) In the left side menu, find "Pages" near the bottom. Click on it.

9) Now in the "Pages" area, under where it says "Branch," click the dropdown. 
   Change it to display "main."
   Then press "Save."

10) It might take a moment or two (like 5 min max) as there is always a delay with GitHub Pages,
    but eventually your profile-card.html will be online...
    The URL will most likely be:
    https://yourusername.github.io/2026-spring-washu-vps-yourname/profile-card.html
    (Make sure to fill in your username and your repository name.)
